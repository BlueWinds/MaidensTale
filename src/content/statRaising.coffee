    You wander around a bit, poking your head into various rooms, but don't manage to find anything interesting. All places you've been before, locked doors and rooms with sounds you don't feel like interrupting lest you be required to join in and lose the rest of your day as someone's entertainment.

    You've discovered... a pool. Why did no one tell you there was an indoor pool? It took a bit of finding - the thing is underground, no windows and an unmarked door. The lack of windows is an intentional part of the effect - blue and green light undulates slowly across the ceiling, giving the whole room the effect of being underwater. Pale blue tiles in rippling patterns slope downward into the water - there's no hard edge to the pool, just a steady slope down towards the deep end. No one's here at the moment, but there's a rack of fresh white towels at each side awaiting use.

    You take note. It's a beautiful place, very relaxing. You might like to spend some time here even if you don't go for a swim.

    You found the kitchen. That's great. What's less great is being chased around by an angry woman with a ladle. Hiding in an alcove along one of the hallways, you hear pounding steps. Oh god, she's found you again.

    Someday you'll have to try visiting without sticking your fingers in a bowl of delicious and beautifully decorated pudding. Totally worth it. You break cover and flee.

    In addition to the two normal closets set aside for your use at any time of day or night (it's rather embarrassing how many pairs of panties you've ruined or lost since coming here), you've found the storage room.

    It's huge. You don't dare take anything out of it - you're not allowed more than the outfits the overseers have chosen to give you - but given how unoccupied it feels, you doubt anyone would mind if you spent a few hours... practicing. Yes, that's what you'll be doing. Definitely not drooling, that would be undignified. You can totally... practice... with that fur coat over there. Or even better, baggy jeans and a t-shirt. You didn't think this country even <em>made</em> clothes that didn't highlight a woman's sexuality.

    The library, oddly enough, is not very extensive. Oh, sure, when you stumble across a room with walls covered floor to ceiling with books it's more than <em>you've</em> ever owned, but compared to the decadence displayed everywhere else in the mansion, one room tucked away in a corner of the third floor is hardly what you'd expected.

    Still, books. It seems well enough used - no dust to be found - but you can probably squirrel yourself up in one of those comfy overstuffed chairs and do some reading if you like. Or study, if that's your thing. Or at take a nap. You do that last one now.

    There's a recording studio. Of course there's a recording studio. Silly to imagine there's a thing this estate isn't equipped for, no matter how unusual. It's not big, just enough for a couple of chairs, but it's soundproof, full of high quality electronics, and there's a closet full of beat up old instruments and songbooks. It must double as a practice room as well. The engineer's booth is empty.

    The place doesn't feel like it gets that much use, so it's probably safe to borrow it whenever you like. The worst they can do is... well, no, you don't want to think about the worst they can do to you. The worst they're <em>likely</em> to do is kick you out.

    You stumble across a great secret - Mr. Stevens' room. Well, it's probably not actually a secret, given there is a sign on the door, but it feels like one. You stand there staring at the door dumbly for a moment before it opens.

    Mr. Stevens is as surprised to see you as you are to see him. He blinks, then steps back into his room, gesturing you to follow.

    It's decorated much like you expected, from what little you know of him. There's a fireplace in one wall flanked by bookshelves, with a huge leather chair facing it. The speckled grey and black tiled floor matches his mustache. His bed is spacious and neatly made. Everything is perfectly in its place.

    "#{g.name}. Why are you here?"

    You take a moment to formulate a response that won't get you punished - you haven't done anything wrong, you know that, but you want to be sure he knows it too. "I didn't know your room was here, I was just passing by."

    He frowns. Not, it takes you a moment to realize, at the content of your words - he's frowning at your slouching stance. "You look like a slob, and like a free woman. Please return another evening and we'll see what we can do to fix that. But for now just go away. I'm busy."

    You flee.

    While you do get fucked a lot, sometimes it would be nice to take your time, go at your own pace... or maybe practice deep-throating things so you don't feel so much like throwing up next time someone skullfucks you.

    There are sex toys everywhere in this building. Like, you can't open a closet without finding a pair of vibrating dildos and a butt plug and maybe a blindfold. The trouble though is finding a place to use them in private, where the sounds you make won't draw someone wanting to take advantage of you.

    But! You've just found a spot, a nice little balcony on the second floor (so no one inside can hear you) sheltered by trees (so no one outside can see you). And, of course, there's a chest full of naughty objects just waiting for use. Because going fifteen feet inside to fetch... a squirt gun filled with lube and a vibrator with a smiley face?... might ruin the mood. You close the chest again and try not to think about who decided to put it there.
