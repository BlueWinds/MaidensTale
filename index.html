You'd never heard of Anglani before three days ago, when you glimpsed it on the arrival gate, disembarking from your airplane. How they'd arranged to have a squirming duffle bag pass through security back home was a mystery to you. When you got off the plane, you were in for another shock: slavery was legal here, and you were now property. The customs official explained it all very clearly - you can't be killed, that's still a crime, but anything short of that is at your owner's discretion. Your immigration form - filled out for you - didn't state a name. You aren't allowed a name until your master chooses one for you. And a slave trading company has no interesting in naming you - that's a privilage be for your new master.\n\nThat was two days ago. Everything since then has been a blur. Somehow you find you've managed to wash yourself - with that done, rough hands drape you in an elegant gown, do your hair, apply makeup and otherwise prepare you in a hurry, getting you ready to sell for the highest possible price. And, just like that, you find yourself stumbling onto the stage.\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, our next piece of meat is a real prize, a genuine never owned free woman.

That leaves you in the hands of a single guard. Briefly, you consider trying to escape -  you're not bound, and there's a whole crowd of people nearby you could try to get lost in, but you abandon the idea when you get a better look at the guard - he's at least a foot taller than you and seemingly made of muscle. He smirks when he sees you looking.\n\n \"Ready as usual\" turns out to involve a great deal of rope and cloth - cloth stuffed in your mouth holding your jaw open then wrapped around your head to hold it in place, more cloth around your eyes, and rope pulling your knees up to your chest and your arms folded along your sides. The whole procedure occurs without regard for your comfort or compliance, leaving you blind, mute and immobile, folded up like a little pill and abandoned on the floor, still naked.\n\n You hear people moving around, people talking about payment, and steps approaching. Suddenly a pair of fingers push themselves into your unprepared pussy. You'd yelp, were you able to make noise, but your startled reaction draws a chuckle anyway. The fingers probe around inside you for a moment before withdrawing.\n\n \"She's a hot little thing, isn't she?\"\n \"Mhm. The " + mistress + " will be pleased. See you at poker night?\"\n \"Of course.\"\n\n The purpose of the ropes - beyond making you helpless - becomes apparent as the place where they gather behind your back becomes a handle, the man lifting you up like a squirming duffle bag. They're not sure how much trouble you'd be left to your own devices, so they're taking no chances. You're carried outside, then into a van. Even if you couldn't see bits and pieces around your blindfold, the change in quality of the surrounding sounds would make that much obvious. The engine starts, and you're off.\n\n It's an uncomfortable ride. Face pressed up against the floor, it seems like you can feel every bump in the road. At least it doesn't last long - you can't be more than a few miles from the auction house when the van comes to a stop again.\n\n \"Welcome to your new home, slut.\" A shoe digs into your side - not unkindly, but enough to make sure you know you're the one being addressed. \"I'm going to remove your blindfold and gag now, and loosen most of the restraints. Feel free to scream. Most new slaves do, and it's best to get it out of your system before I open the door and everyone sees you. Wouldn't make a good first impression to be acting like a wild animal caught in a cage, now would it?\" He leans down so his voice is right in your ear. \"That is what you are though, a wild animal. Don't worry though, we'll tame you.\"\n\n\"I'm untying you now.\" He reaches down and begins to unwrap the gag. \"We'll put up with a lot, especially in your first few days. One thing we never tollerate is attacking any of the overseers or other slaves. Hurting people is my job, not yours.\"\n\n" + options + "\n\n<em>In addition to your skills, you have three mood bars, which fill up with different emotions.

His follow up kick to your gut is, however, leaving you twisting on the floor gasping for breath while he cradles a bloody hand.\n\n\"I warned you, bitch. Now, we have some things to do right this second, but come tomorrow, or the day after, or the day after that... you'll regret it. We like to make people live in suspense about what exactly that means. You've just earned your first punishment.\" He kicks you again, and while you're still curled up in pain, rolls you over onto your face with his foot.

Eventually he lets go, and with a handkerchief from one pocket, wipes off your face, an action welcome despite the indignity of having him do it for you.\n\n\"That's a good girl.\" He stands and opens the door, and after a moment looking around, \"Hey Joel!
